Project Name: A DAY IN QUARANTINE LIFE    

Project Description: What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.    

The whole film and the website revolves around the idea of quarantine and mental health. Due to prevailing circumstances, considering the health of the community, institutes have adopted the online education model. While quarantine activities were fruitful to many, many found their mental health to be declining. During the 30 minutes film festival activity, the first idea a group of four strangers agreed was about quarantine and its struggles. The whole team tried their best to share their perspective on quarantine in their ways. The idea for the film was to make it realistic and light heart as much as possible.    

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.    

The video was made by using props (spatula, tea bag, apple, banana) to aid the process of sharing one's realistic quarantine routine. It was shot on four different devices and then compiled together and edited. Calming background music was ended to achieve the purpose of calming our viewers. For the same purpose, the text and background colors have been kept a light on the eyes and chosen from pastel shades of purple. Some instances of humor were added in the film to keep it light-hearted and elevate the mood of the viewers. A similar approach was used when adding other content on the website (e.g. about section and quotes section).  Furthermore, some elements of interactivity were added to the website to improve the user's experience and to get them involved. This would indirectly distract their negative thoughts and help them calm down. A quote slider dot container and scrollable webpage were made for this purpose.     

Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

This assignment is my first experience working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The initial sketch was made on Adobe XD. Due to time constraints and some issues, much of the layout was changed. Additionally, the color scheme and font styles were different too. During writing the code, the font style and color scheme was updated to achieve my goal of making a light, calming webpage. Much of the experience was trial and error. Alot of time was spend on internet figuring out how to include certain elements in my project and then customizing the styling as per requirement. To get started, I used bootstrap. However, towards the end of project, I grasped better understanding of various tags and procedures and was able to create my desired template by writing the html and css code from scratch. I would like to conclude this by stating that despite a rocky start, this project has been a great learning experience.

Project Name: A pilot’s Journey

Project Description: What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

The main theme/idea behind the comic was to talk about how some nations are handling covid 19 situation and the effects of covid 19 on some nations. One of the key ideas was to state both former mentioned goals in a lighthearted way. The intention is not at all to joke about the situation , but for sarcastically make people realize their wrong actions at wrong times and giving them an insight on how badly many places have been affected. The whole team had their minds set on making the project a lighthearted experience for viewers as well as an opportunity to assess the current pandemic situation where many nations are still at risk of second wave. 


Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.

The main idea was collectively decided within the group. For images, after collecting some inspiration from web and discussion within group, Shamma and I made basic first sketches on paper and divided the work amongst ourselves. To ensure lighthearted experience, we decided on making our panels colorful and use light colors and avoid dark hues as much as we can. For the text script too, the written content is kept to minimum and font styles are also kept simple. The text color is also kept light and smooth simple animations are added in the comic to keep the whole experience lively and light.


Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

This assignment is my first experience with comics in general (reading for ideas, creating new ones). I was responsible for drawing images through illustrator. The initial sketches were made on paper and then corresponding part of image were looked up on web and then traced on illustrator using pen tool. In the beginning much of the time was spent on playing with different tools and features of illustrator. This included looking up on google for how to do help with some tools. The first panel took quite a while but after it was a very pleasant experience working with illustrator (for I got to practice more of my favorite free time activity). The process also making changes accordingly after rendering the code on browser and removing some major imperfections. Due to time constraint, some of minor imperfections in drawings were not addressed. Despite a challenging journey, this project has been a great learning experience.

Project Name: The Missing Child

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
Our sound project is focused on a mysterious kidnapping and murder. This genre was decided after my partner and I had goals to create a sound piece that triggers audiences’ wild imagination through abstraction. Without explicit mention of place, characters and plot, the concept behind this particular storyline and implementation is to grab audience attention and interest in the project till the end. Another reason for leaving a lot to imagination with subtle hints was to create a highly individualized experience which could lead to conversation amongst the group of individuals figuring out the correct (or intended) implementation.  Another goal of this project was to be able to gauge interest of large audiences (specifically suspense, horror, mystery, murder, and triller lovers) and most importantly visually impaired audience.

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.
The storyline was implemented in three parts: where (location), who (characters) and why (cliffhanger). To achieve our goal of triggering audiences’ imagination through imagination, the background sounds for location are kept to minimum and suspense/horror background sounds are added to intensify the effects. A few hints about the kidnapper’s appearance and personality are given to audience through the conversation between kidnapper and child throughout the storyline. The story is ended on a cliff hanger without the reason of kidnapping or murder (intentional or unintentional) being revealed. To attract the visually impaired audience, the sound piece is created to be able to provide standalone experience. Visuals have been incorporated to the website as an additional experience, where visually impaired would not lose any real/ intended experience.

Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
Initially, we had two project ideas: soundscape to show difference between same public locations of two or more countries and murder mystery. The first idea was scrapped after we realize that a few fellow students were working on similar concept. To add diversity on plate, we went with murder mystery. Considering it to be too dark for some audiences, we initially planned on having two alternate endings. However, the idea was not followed we decided to stick with one ending. I was responsible for script (which involved back and forth changes until the last minute), finding all the possible sounds and visuals from web and designing different visuals (e.g posters, logos etc) for the website. In short, I carried out the creative tasks while my partner worked on technical implementation. For the creative process, I can conclude that our main goals were successfully accomplished. However, considering the time constraint we decided on simple technical implementation (rather than our initial plans of adding a lot of interactivity on webpage). This project had been very overwhelming for me as we juggled with work in the time limit and constantly evolving script and creative content. However, in the end, we managed to achieve our realistically expected project.
